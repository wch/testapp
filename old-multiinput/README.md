This app has HTML generated by Shiny 0.5.0. The purpose of the app is to make sure that old-style multi-inputs are bound properly, even with newer versions of shiny.js, which have new multi-input bindings.

Selecting the checkboxes and radio buttons should make corresponding outputs print the value.
